# _data/club/geo

These are data files for club geo locations. One file for each club. The file name should be the club numerical strava id, 
such as [327007](https://www.strava.com/clubs/327007).

You can erify club location visually by viewing .geojson files in the [map/club](https://github.com/mocaspike150/api/tree/master/map/club) folder.

To create new clubs and locations, please follow the format of existing clubs and use [http://geojson.io](http://geojson.io) 
Web UI to set a pin to the club location and copy paste location data into the YAML file. 

There are tons of YAML checkers on line. Use whatever works for you. Such as [this one](https://yamlchecker.com/) which has no ads.
