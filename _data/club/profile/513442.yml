desc: In 2019, Museum of Chinese in America (MOCA) celebrates the 150th anniversary to mark the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad. To commemorate this milestone, MOCA has launched the MOCA Spike 150 initiative. This nine-month journey will allow MOCA to tell 150 untold stories in the making of America as participants of MOCA Spike 150 run across the country culminating in the TCS NYC Marathon on November 3, 2019. MOCA welcomes you to join us in this unprecedented initiative, and welcomes runners to follow in the footsteps of this countryâ€™s first pioneers and make history.
