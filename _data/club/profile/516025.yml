desc: Flying Foxes Running Club is a group of Chinese runners based in Charlotte, NC.  Since 2012, we have been participating Blue Ridge Relay (BRR) with various teams (sometimes multiple) including seasoned runners and new runners.   BRR (http://blueridgerelay.com/) is a 36 legs, 200+ miles relay, starting at Grayson Highlands State Park VA and ending at Asheville NC, thru the beautiful Blue Ridge Parkway.  We are welcome all runners, Chinese, or not, local, or not.
