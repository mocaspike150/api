  On October 23, 2015 a group of alumni of Peking University founded RUN 100871. It now has about 1,000 active members around the world. All of us have studied at our beloved Alma Mater—Peking University—and now are reconnected through running wherever we are. Meeting friends, staying healthy, and running for a better world are our shared goals.
